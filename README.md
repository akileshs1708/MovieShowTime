# MovieShowTime â€“ Let the Movie Begin

**Showtime** is a C-based movie ticket booking system that simulates a real-world cinema ticketing experience. The project offers a terminal-based interface where users can view currently available movies, check showtimes, book tickets, and manage seat reservations. An admin panel is included for managing movie listings and show details.
